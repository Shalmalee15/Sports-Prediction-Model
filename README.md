# Sport Prediction Model

## **README: Sports Prediction Model**

### **Project Overview**
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the outcomes of sports events. Using historical match data, player statistics, and other relevant features, the model aims to forecast the result of upcoming games (e.g., win/loss/draw). 

### **Features**
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for sports datasets.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and trends.
- Training and evaluation of classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance.
- Deployment-ready script for predicting future matches.

### **Dataset**
We use the [Football Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer) from Kaggle, which contains match results, team statistics, and player data. Alternatively, you can use other sports datasets, such as NBA or cricket data.

### **Setup Instructions**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sports-prediction-model.git
   cd sports-prediction-model
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` folder.
4. Run the Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` folder for EDA.
5. Train the model using:
   ```bash
   python src/model_training.py
   ```
6. Make predictions using:
   ```bash
   python src/prediction_script.py
   ```
